# Building the first classes

It is vital that you have some understanding of what Classes are and why we use them in programming. They are the most common structural elements that our application uses and in Desktop Application development in Visual Studio, everything really is a class.

Our classes are used to manage data and methods that work with the data required by the application.

Before you begin this video, watch a short video about Classes and Object Oriented Programming. 

The video is here: [What is a class?](https://youtu.be/qPFIGdct3Js).

## Application classes for our solution

We will focus on making data and methods avialable before we use them.

The Classes in this video are
* ImportData
* * Gets data from a text file and puts into as format our application can use
* Person
* * used to hold data about the user of the application during processing
* Activity
* * used to hold data about the activities the user undertakes in the gym
